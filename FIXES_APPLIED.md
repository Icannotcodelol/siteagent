# Fixes Applied for Document Upload Issues

## Issue 1: 401 Error on Processing Stats API ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The processing status endpoint was calling `/api/admin/document-processing` which requires admin authentication, but regular users don't have admin access.

**Solution**: 
1. Created a new user-accessible endpoint: `/api/chatbots/[chatbotId]/processing-status/route.ts`
2. This endpoint:
   - Validates user authentication
   - Ensures user owns the chatbot
   - Returns processing statistics for the specific chatbot
3. Updated `useProcessingStatus` hook to use the new endpoint

**Files Changed**:
- ✅ `src/app/api/chatbots/[chatbotId]/processing-status/route.ts` (new file)
- ✅ `src/lib/hooks/use-documents.ts` (updated endpoint URL)

## Issue 2: Document Status Not Updating in Real-time ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Document status was showing "pending" but only updated to "completed" after page refresh. Real-time subscriptions weren't working properly.

**Solution**:
1. **Improved Real-time Subscription**:
   - Enhanced channel naming for uniqueness
   - Added better error handling and status logging
   - Added small delay before cache invalidation for database consistency
   - Added proper cleanup for toast notifications

2. **Enhanced Cache Management**:
   - Invalidate both documents and processing-status queries on updates
   - Added logging for better debugging
   - Improved refetch behavior

3. **Better Toast Management**:
   - Dismiss existing toasts before showing new ones
   - Added specific toasts for different status transitions
   - Handle deleted documents by dismissing their toasts

4. **Fixed SSR Issue**:
   - Fixed `window is not defined` error in embed-code-display component
   - Added proper client-side origin detection with loading state

**Files Changed**:
- ✅ `src/lib/hooks/use-documents.ts` (improved real-time subscription and caching)
- ✅ `src/app/dashboard/chatbot/[id]/_components/embed-code-display.tsx` (fixed SSR issue)
